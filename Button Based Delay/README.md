# Button Based Delay
Using the G2553 and F5529 boards, the button delay was implemented. The basic function of the button delay is to set the blinking frequency of the LED(s) on the board by holding down a button. The amount of time that the button is held down is the frequency at which the button would blink. Holding the button down for 3 seconds would cause a corresponding LED toggle delay of 3 seconds.

By setting CCR0  = 103, that set the CCR0 register to 10HZ. Once the internal clock reaches this number, the timer interrupt would be triggered. The LEDs begin to toggle on and off after this occurrence. The button interrupt occurs when the user presses the button, which is written in code as a conditional if statement. Basically, if the button is pressed, the frequency will change to however long the button is pressed for. Once the button is released,  the CCR0 register gets the duration of time that the button was pressed for, and the LED toggles on and off at this rate. The interrupt flag is cleared and prepared for the next time the button is pressed.

The ports were once again different for the G2553 and the F5529, as well as the timer names (TACCTL instead of CCTL, TACCR0 instead of CCR0).
